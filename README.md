# Mercury calculator for seaturtles.org.

This is a prototype. The goal is to get it working well enough to test with users. After that's complete, let's refactor and integrate this into the seaturtles website.

**Design files**
https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/Mercury-Calculator-Prototype-ck9vl8l7500l1l901y8d0n3fc

**Getting started**

Run on localhost, I can't remember why.

Use Sass to generate CSS files.

**Dependencies**

* Jquery - This is probably unnecessary. When we move from prototype to real thing, consider removing
* Mustache.js - This is making life very easy, converting from JSON to html. Replace if there's a better option
* Sass
* Charts library TBD - this is probably unnecessary for the one bar chart on the results page...

**Post-Prototype To Do list**

* Integrate into client wordpress site
* Add support for spanish language version
* Add support for Google Sheets - client should be able to update in sheets
